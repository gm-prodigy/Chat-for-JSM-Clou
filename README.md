# Chat-for-JSM-Clou
This is an IPS plugin I made when someone requested it.

It was made for IPS forums software https://invisioncommunity.com/ for version v4.7.14, haven't tested on older versions but it should still work.

I don't know much about JSM, but this app was created to work with the following documentation below.
